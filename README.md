- Hey, I'm Jacob

- I currently work in insurance, drudging away for a paycheck, using my free time to build a more interesting and challenging career.

- I’m interested in web development, data science/analysis, and AI/machine learning (wide variety there, eh?)

- I’m currently learning Python, jumping to the Full-Stack Developer track on Codecademy when I finish the Python 2 course. 

- I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really. I'm just developing the skills needed to build substantial, real-world projects.

- How to reach me: jacob.2815@gmail.com, @jacobg2815 on twitter, hopefully I get a portfolio site built soon to add here.

- Trivia
  - I started college with an exercise science major before switching to computer science. 
    - I failed Calculus and Discrete Maths due to depression and anxiety leading to frequent skipped classes.
    - I quite enjoyed the coding classes, which is what brings me back six years later.
  - I was 370 lbs in December 2019. I'm 230 lbs today. Lowest I got was 215 before the pandemic, and I got up to almost 250 last fall before getting back on my horse.
  - I wrote a 77,000 word space fantasy thriller that I finished in May 2021. Actively submitting to agents and waiting for responses.
  - I was a sports reporter in college (my degree is in Journalism), and have about 20 articles published from the four months I worked there.
    - I also wrote the cover story for the Alumni Association quarterly magazine (unrelated to sports). 
  - I jump at the chance for extraneous work projects, which typically fall between data analysis and graphic design projects, two things I quite enjoy.
    - Created multiple quick reference job aids (made them visually appealing and official looking) and beautified multiple excel sheets used for tracking data.
    - Performed data analysis with a specific goal and made a recommendation that directly resulted in a change to departmental functions.
